<br/>

<hr/>
Kreader is the innovation project proposal from our team, FLL 60174 Tangy Tech, for FLL 2023-2024 Masterpiece competition season. 
The aim of Kreader is to encourage more kids to read by enabling an immersive and interactive reading experience on AR/VR headsets, utilizing contents generated from AI technologies such as <a href="https://chat.openai.com">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/">Midjourney</a>, <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai">Perplexity.ai</a> and <a href="https://filme.imyfone.com/voice-recorder/">Voxbox</a>. 
<br/><br/>
This demo Kreader VR app is developed using <a href="https://aframe.io">A-Frame</a> technology with a targeted full immersive and interactive experience with <a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/products/quest-2/">Meta Quest VR headset</a>. We learned HTML, Javascript, A-Frame, 3D models and other related technologies in preparation for this prototype development. 
We chose A-Frame given it is a web framework for building 3D/AR/VR experiences. A-Frame is based on top of HTML, making it simple to get started, compared with more feature-rich but complext solutions such as Unity. 

<br/><br/>
A-Frame also provides a set of basic and instructive examples that introduce the various features of the <a class="toc" href="https://aframe.io/">A-Frame</a> library, and to introduce new A-Frame components.
During our development of this VR App prototype, we heavily referenced the open source A-Frame interactive virtual reality components such as interactive-book, music-player, and model-viewer (<a class="toc" href="https://github.com/stemkoski/A-Frame-Examples">A-Frame example collections</a>).

	The best experience is achieved when you use a Quest VR headset and controllers. Though you can play with Kreader on any desktop computer that has a Chrome Browser installed and use keyboard and mouse to navigate. 
	<br></br>
	For app experiences on mobile phones, we have tested with Android phones with Cardboard VR headsets. 
	There is an known issue with Cardboard VR headsets support on iOS that requires an upgraded version of A-Frame. This is in our backlog to fix.

	Instructions for Quest controllers: The "interactive-book" component creates an interactive model of a book with pages rendered from a PDF file
	using the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js">pdf.js</a> library. Pointing at the book and pressing the right trigger enables interactivity (indicated by the power light changing from red to green). While activated, the "player-move" component is deactivated; moving the Quest joysticks left/right and pressing the A/B/X/Y buttons will turn the pages of the book. Clicking on the book with the right trigger a second time will pause the interaction and reactivate the "player-move" component.
	For the "media-player" component, pointing at the button and pressing the right trigger to play/pause/stop the audio. To reveal the 3D models, make sure the cursor is inside the portal and press the right trigger to enter the 3D model.
	<br/><br/> 
	Instructions for keyboard and mouse: Use the Left/Right/Up/Down keys on the keyboard to navigate around. Use key "E" to flip pages forward and "Q" to flip pages backward. Use key "P" to play the audio and "O" to stop the audio. To reveal the 3D models, use left/right arrow keys to move the circle shaped cursor to the portal area and click the mouse to enter the 3D model.
